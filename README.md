# Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm

This project provides a comprehensive approach for verifying medical documents using advanced techniques in template extraction, comparison, and fraud detection.

## Methodology Overview

### Template Extraction
- **Region-of-Interest (ROI) Methods**: Utilizes sophisticated techniques for precise extraction.
- **Contour Analysis and Edge Detection**: Enhances the clarity of templates.
- **Pre-processing**: Includes morphological operations and adaptive thresholding.

### Template Comparison
- **Feature Matching**: Utilizes key points and descriptors.
- **Histogram-Based Analysis**: Improves robustness by accounting for variations.

### Fraud Detection
- **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: Quantifies structural similarity to identify potential matches.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts critical information such as patient details, provider information, and billing amounts.
- **Data Comparison**: Compares extracted information with a reference dataset.
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Ensures reliable fraud detection.

### Adaptability
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: System parameters adapt to varying document layouts and structures.

This methodology ensures a robust and adaptable approach to medical document verification, effectively addressing the complexities of template extraction, comparison, fraud detection, and document structure variability.
